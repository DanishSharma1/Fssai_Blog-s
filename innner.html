        <h2>Strengthening food safety systems through global collaboration</h2> 
        <p class="post-meta"> 
            <b class="increasehead">
            By Shri G. Kamala Vardhana Rao
        </b>
        </p> 
        <p class="fontstyling"> 
            Food safety is a global issue that transcends boundaries and geographical locations. Safe food is
            essential for a sound health and food safety is critical to the policy makers of any nation for securing
            public health and the economic strength and stability of a nation. The burden of foodborne diseases
            to public health and to economies is a matter of concern. According to the World Health
            Organization (WHO), approximately 600 million people fall ill each year due to about 200 different
            types of foodborne diseases. The burden of these illnesses disproportionately affects the poor and
            the young. Tragically, foodborne diseases are responsible for 420,000 preventable deaths annually
            worldwide. <br><br>
            The 2019 World Bank report on the economic burden of the foodborne diseases indicated that the
            total productivity loss associated with foodborne disease in low- and middle-income countries was
            estimated at US$ 95.2 billion per year, and the annual cost of treating foodborne illnesses is
            estimated at US$ 15 billion. Addressing the burden of foodborne diseases is a crucial task for
            safeguarding public health and ensuring economic stability for a better quality of life of people
            around the globe. <br><br>
            The Global Food Regulators Summit 2023, an endeavour of the Ministry of Health and Family
            Welfare demonstrates India’s commitment to strengthening the global food safety ecosystem. The
            summit aims to create a cohesive approach to food safety and regulatory frameworks by facilitating
            discussions and sharing best practices among food regulators and research institutions from around
            the world, thereby ensuring safe and quality food for all. <br><br>
            Through this summit, India provided a crucial platform for global food regulators from over 40
            countries, including G20 member countries, to collaborate and strategize on transforming the food
            safety ecosystem and regulatory frameworks. Apart from the Codex Alimentarius Commission
            created by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of
            the United Nations 60 years ago, this is the first time food regulators from across the world gathered
            under the same roof for a global regulatory conference of such magnitude. <br><br>
            Apart from regulators, reputed international organisations, including WHO, FAO, Codex Alimentarius
            Commission, World Food Programme and 25 international research institutes and Universities took
            part in the Summit. A total of around 5,000 people took part over two days at the plenary sessions,
            exhibition and concurrent CEO’s meetings held as part of the summit, which over one lakh people
            joined virtually. This included around 40,000 food business operators, 35,000 students/research
            institutes, 6,000 exporters, 5,000 importers, 3,500 food safety officers, 2,500 food safety trainees,
            2,000 laboratory officials, 1,000 Food Safety Mitras and Indian Missions Officials in 60 countries
            across the world. <br><br>
            Key goals of the summit included establishing a platform for exchanging information on food
            product regulatory and safety requirements. The discussion centred around five crucial areas divided
            into as many technical sessions – Global Regulatory Framework, Anti-Microbial Resistance:
            Challenges and Solutions for Global Food Safety, Best Practices on Robust Standards Setting
            Framework, Impact of Animal Feed on Food Safety and Human Health, and Innovation in Food
            Emergency Responses, Recall and Analysis. <br><br>
            The Global Food Regulators Summit introduced ground-breaking initiatives that will transform the
            accessibility and sharing of food safety information. These included the launch of Food-o-Copoeia, a
            comprehensive collection of food category-wise monographs that serve as a single-point reference
            for all applicable standards and regulatory provisions, covering aspects such as quality standards,
            <br><br>
            food safety measures, labelling and claim requirements, packaging specifications and testing
            methods. <br><br>
            Additionally, the common regulators platform called ‘SaNGRAH’ – Safe food for Nations: Global food
            Regulatory Authorities Handbook features a database of Food Regulatory Authorities from 76
            countries, providing insights into their mandates, food safety ecosystems, food testing facilities,
            contact details etc. Furthermore, a Common Digital Dashboard, a unified IT portal offering
            comprehensive information on standards, regulations, notifications, advisories, guidelines,
            contamination limits and the latest developments by food regulators in India has also been launched
            as part of the summit. <br><br>
            India, taking the lead… <br><br>
            In 1964, India became one of the first countries to join Codex and has host chaired the Committee
            on Spices and Culinary Herbs, apart from chairing and co-chairing many working groups. From the
            enactment of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Law in 1954 to the formation of the Food Safety
            and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), the focus in the country has moved from just preventing
            food adulteration to ensuring food safety through setting of standards and nudging consumers
            towards right eating choices. India’s food market is currently valued at 905.2 billion USD and it is
            projected to grow annually at a substantial rate of 8.4%. As one of the world’s major food producers
            and exporters, India plays a crucial role in the global food safety ecosystem. The country has
            exported food products worth 172.48 billion USD over the past five years (2017-18 to 2021-22).
            Given the immense scale of the food value chain worldwide, India has taken the lead in addressing
            global food safety challenges and this conference serves as a significant platform for promoting
            international cooperation, knowledge sharing, and cross-learning, aiming to create a safer and more
            sustainable global food system. The Food Safety and Standards Act now encompasses more than 710
            products and 31 principle regulations have been formulated, which includes milk, meat, organic
            food, pesticide, nutraceuticals etc. <br><br>
            The food authority in India has a Scientific Committee and 21 Scientific Panels that are its principal
            scientific arms in the standards development process while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
            has 49 technical and scientific advisory committees. The European Food Safety Authority has 10
            scientific panels that include external scientific experts. The European Parliament’s Committee for
            Environment, Public Health and Food Safety plays a crucial role in legislation related to most of the
            food sector. <br><br>
            The laboratory approval system at EU, US, Australia and New Zealand includes primary, referral and
            reference labs under private and government sector, which is similar to the system in India. The
            Canadian Food Inspection Agency has 13 reference and research laboratories, New Zealand has two
            national laboratories and 119 accredited laboratories. In Australia, there are seven laboratories that
            are approved for testing imported food. While Germany has 14 national reference laboratories, UK
            has 29 national reference laboratories. <br><br>
            India has a network of 246 laboratories for food testing, including four National Food Labs of the
            FSSAI. Out of the total notified laboratories, 13 have been recognised as reference labs for
            development and validation of new methods of testing. India also has the world’s largest network of
            mobile food labs – ‘Food Safety on Wheels’ – which brings testing facilities and food safety
            education to the remotest corners of this vast country.
            <br><br>
            Food safety is an integral part of our public health system and India has been a pioneer of this
            sector, which includes bringing regulation for Ayurveda Aahara and Vegan food. Historically
            speaking, ships laden with spices and condiments would take the ‘Spice Route’ from India to the
            western world, taking along food and food habits. Post globalisation, Japanese food is enjoyed by
            people in the US while food of the Middle East is easily available in Japan. As Hon’ble Prime Minister
            Shri Narendra Modi rightly said ‘One Earth,’ ‘One Family’ and ‘One Future’, every country is eating
            food imported from the other country. <br><br>
            India’s ancient tradition of Yoga and its universal appeal has found a significant global platform
            thanks to the International Yoga Day celebrated on June 21st every year, as proposed by Hon’ble
            Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi during his address to the United Nations General Assembly on
            September 27, 2014. Just as the International Yoga Day has helped bring global attention towards
            the holistic approach of this ancient practice towards health and wellness, the Global Food
            Regulators Summit would become an international platform where regulators, policy makers and
            scientists can exchange ideas and collaborate to counter emerging hazards, changing consumer
            habits, pandemic situations etc. <br><br>
            The Global Food Regulators Summit would act as the catalyst for a future where food safety for all is
            ensured through international collaboration, open dialogues and the sharing of experiences and
            innovations.
